          <p>
            As the son and grandson of Mexican fieldworkers who first came to the US without an education, Brian made an early decision in his career to ensure that individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have access to a quality education.

          </p>
            With more than a decade of global experience, Brian has worked across the world developing training and leadership development programs for young educators. As technology continues to become quotidian in today's modern world, Brian aspires to weave together his passion for education with his newfound skill set in coding.
